It has a horrible plot, boring characters, and absolutely no depth. It is a horny 14-year old's version of a sci-fi film with a hot robot woman objectified to the point of being sexual in the worst possible way, disgusting men on dirt bikes for no reason ravaging the wastelands, a strip club in the middle of nowhere because, obviously, strip clubs are more in need in this wasteland than water. There is also Snoop Dogg. Why?\n\nThe multiple unnecessary story arcs were frustrating to watch. There is no connection or chemistry between any of the characters, least of all, between Prince and the robot. (Why is there a robot?) \n\nThe personalities of the characters are so stereotypical, a sexy objectified (and obviously naked) robot gaining consciousness, a young man searching for a cure for his mother, an ugly James Franco just murdering and assaulting people for no reason whatsoever, a token black-haired-eyeliner-heavy queer woman and snoop fucking Dogg.\n\nThe entire movie is ridiculous, pointless, and has no direction. Why does the Hispanic/white prince boy have an Asian mom? It's a terribly executed sci-fi cliche that shouldn't have been made in the first place. It's possibly James Franco's worst role and he directed the movie.\n\nIf the movie makers can afford Snoop Dogg, they should've been able to afford one sane scriptwriter. If you have absolutely nothing else to watch, skip this movie anyway. \n\n\n\n\n "],"suggestionText":["","","","","","","","","",""," and \"Hollywood\" for example.
