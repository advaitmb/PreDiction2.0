So yeah if you have nothing good to do and someone asks you to see this, I guess go ahead, it does have slight comedy in it. ","Loqueesha is a movie based on the life events of a guy who pretends to be a Black woman to get a job as a radio talk show host. Its definitely not a \"good\" movie than one would suggest others, but its okay-ish. The acting is quite blunt and not very well done, and the writing was also weird. Visually the film is not well framed and has a very low budget early 2000s movie vibe. It kind of reminds me of the movie ' The Room', in terms of the videography and acting. In a way the movie is a bit racist as it stereotypes a lot of races and the genders, but definitely not as bad and insulting as majority if the reviews say. But nonetheless its not a very good movie and i wouldn't really recommend it, but i did have a laugh here and there so yeah i wont say it was a waste of my time.
