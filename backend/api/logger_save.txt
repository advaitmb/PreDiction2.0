Both films, Nausicaa and Mononoke, discuss the disruption and corruption of nature and its clash with the human need to survive and thrive. What one notices however, is that while Mononoke treats restraint and peace as its message, Nausicaa puts forth true, unconditional love and compassion as its answer to the horrible crisis it is set in. Characters that are designed to look like villains and monsters are repeatedly treated with reverence, care, and respect. Our titular Nausicaa embodies this herself - willing to sacrifice herself such that an infant 'Ohm', an insect, is returned to its parental horde - and hoping that by doing so she will be able to stave off the cataclysmic rage of the Ohm masses. Blame for the crisis, the 'Sea of Decay' is made clear in the film, which explains that industrial greed of past put horrible toxins into the earth - toxins which spread through the spores of polluted plants, causing debilitating disease. What we learn over the course of the film, however, is that nature is trying to heal itself too - and would likely be able too if humans would be able to quit misinterpreting and attacking its efforts to do so.\n\nNausicaa is, in my opinion, an essential film.

Both films, Nausicaa and Mononoke, discuss the disruption and corruption of nature and its clash with the human need to survive and thrive. What one notices however, is that while Mononoke treats restraint and peace as its message, Nausicaa puts forth true, unconditional love and compassion as its answer to the horrible crisis it is set in. Characters that are designed to look like villains and monsters are repeatedly treated with reverence, care, and respect. Our titular Nausicaa embodies this herself - willing to sacrifice herself such that an infant 'Ohm', an insect, is returned to its parental horde - and hoping that by doing so she will be able to stave off the cataclysmic rage of the Ohm masses. Blame for the crisis, the 'Sea of Decay' is made clear in the film, which explains that industrial greed of past put horrible toxins into the earth - toxins which spread through the spores of polluted plants, causing debilitating disease.
